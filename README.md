# Anti-AFK-Python
A gui based app that has a few settings that can help stop your computer from going to sleep. Very useful for rendering long sequences or animations in 3d software, when you want your computer to stay awake. If you find any bugs or issues, feel free to work on the code. If you need help getting it up and running, you can reach me at piffle#8822 on discord. Keep in mind that ive only tested this software on MacOS machines, but it will hopefully run fine on other operating systems.


## Dependancies
This program relies on DearPyGUI `pip install dearpygui` or `pip3 install dearpygui`
And PyAutoGUI `pip install pyautogui`
